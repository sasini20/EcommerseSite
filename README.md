Our eCommerce website addresses a common real-world problem: individuals who purchase event tickets but later become unable to attend. 
Instead of letting these tickets go to waste, our platform provides a secure and convenient solution by allowing users to resell unwanted tickets to others.
This site acts as a community-driven resale marketplace where users can list their tickets for sale, and interested buyers can browse and purchase them. 
It ensures fair access to event tickets, reduces wastage, and helps buyers find tickets for sold-out or in-demand events at reasonable prices.
Through this platform, we aim to create a transparent, user-friendly environment benefiting both sellers and buyers.
